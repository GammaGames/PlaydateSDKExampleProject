# Example Project

This project contains the files to work with the Playdate SDK on Linux with VSCode. Talk about a niche! Included is a base game and build tasks made (by @SquidGodDev) and preset `.vscode` settings (by @Minalien)!

## Project Structure

I tried to structure the `source` folder so you could use this template as both a full project, or as a "scratchpad" (copy the `base` folder and test an idea--VSCode shows the folder as a single line anyway)
